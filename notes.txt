METHOD 1
========

1. calculate end points for b-lines (3b node â€“ position for the pulley)

 paramaters: z distance from kite.
   y-pos for 3b nodes (foilwise direction):
   assume pull is mostly from b line attachment points  so average over y pos of those position over foils
   weighing with foil size.

   x-pos: assuming direct lines from end point to each foil, find x-position where total x-z direction of pull
   matches direction to split point of flying lines.

2. 2b nodes

 parameters: 2-b line lengths
    given length from 3b to opposite deirection from bar attachment

3. 1b nodes

 parameters: 3-b line lengths
   for given 1b-line connected to the 2b node calculate average direction of pull from the two attachment points
   and go to that direction given distance to get the 1b node positions



4. 3a and 3c nodes:
 z coord should be same for both and determined by flying line length.
 x coord shoul be determined from the x-z direcrion of pull assumed on the 3b-nodes,
 however, c- nodes cpuld be moved slightly outwards and c-nodes repectively inwrds due to bar length.
 Hard do determine the optimal distance but that is hardly important, much less than half bar length for cnodes anyway,
 and for anodes with ratio of middle-front/middle-tail distance.
pretty much same as for 3b node
--------------naah.. assume zero force fomr the a-c bridles: can be determied by b3 node direction of pull and bar aatchments....
