bridle calculation

METHOD 1
========

x: chordwise axis
y: kite lengthwise axis

1. calculate end points for b-lines (2b node â€“ position where b-line splits to n lines going towards foil pairs)

   assume pull is mostly from b line attachment points  so sum direction of pull  over foils
   weighing with foil size. to get resultant y-z force F and momentum M wrt origin.
   Assume the middlefoil is roughtly at origin, and skin tension from other half of kite
   provides force along y axis in origin.
   At 2b the flying line provides force towards flying line split point.
   Taking 2b === (y, z) as reference point, and requiring total force and momentum to vanish there
   we can solve for y,z line:
   z*c + y*s_z -s_z * c = 0
   where c = M/F and s_z the split point z.

   Take x as the area weighted average over the foils bline attachment points.


   y:
     Mp = M0 - F cross p == 0
     M0 - Fy*pz + Fz*py = 0
     => pz == py*Fz/Fy + M0   // line where momentum vanishes

2. 3b nodes
 parameters: 2-b line lengths
    given length from 2b towards split point

3. 1b nodes

 parameters: 3-b line lengths
   for given 1b-line connected to the 2b node calculate average direction of pull from the two attachment points
   and go to that direction given distance to get the 1b node positions

4. 3a and 3c nodes:
 z coord should be same for both and determined by flying line length.
 x coord for a node determined from the x-z direcrion from 3b to flying lne split point.
 x coord for c node determined from the x-z direcrion from 3b to bar end point.
 y coords???
pretty much same as for 3b node
--------------naah.. assume zero force fomr the a-c bridles: can be determied by b3 node direction of pull and bar aatchments....

5. 2a,2c nodes
y,z can be same as for 2b.
x: in line from 3a to average of attachment points???
